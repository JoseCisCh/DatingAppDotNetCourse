# Dating App

This app is being developed in the Udemy course I am enrolled in (*Build an app with ASPNET Core and Angular from scratch* by Neil Cummings). All the credit of the application idea to Neil Cummings. Im just sharing my progress in this repository.

During the development of this application I've been learning different concepts of the ASP.NET Core network framework, this has been adding a lot of knowledge to my backend stack.
Talking about the frontend application it has been being developed using Angular.

For both ASP.NET Core and Angular I have been using the CLI tools provided by both frameworks.
